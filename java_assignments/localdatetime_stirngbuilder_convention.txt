Reflect on class, function and variable naming conventions on StringBuilder or LocalDateTime class
 

STRING BUILDER:-As we know the Strings class provides an immutable succession of characters
	       but by using Stringbuilder class let us to create a mutable and modifiable succession of characters.

LocalDateTime:-Java LocalDateTime class is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time,
 	      with the default format as yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-s

StrinBuilder 
- It is a mutable sequence of characters.
- The class provides no guarantee of synchronization.
- Class names are typed in uppercase and meaningful.
- Variables and function names are typed in a camel case.

LocalDateTime
- To display date and time
- It is final class and no extension of the class is allowed
- Class names are typed in uppercase and meaningful.
- Variables and function names are typed in a camel case.

These conventions have become apart of Java that all the developers should follow.
